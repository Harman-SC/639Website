## Our Project

We spent this semester working on a face mask detector, using our own CNN model. The purpose is pretty self-explanatory: it simply detects whether a face mask is being worn properly or not. 

## Why Face Mask Detection?

With the ongoing pandemic not slowing down as much as initially thought, it remains vital to ensure that the services and buildings that need extra security have it. Being in a college campus with over 40,000 students means that often times, academic and social buildings will require students to be in close proximity to each other indoors, and with new variants of COVID-19 popping up, we think that face mask detection is more crucial here and around the world more than ever. 

## So Why Us?

While the model we used may not be as accurate as the current state of the art, which we will touch on later, we found that this idea was the best way to make a real-world connection to the material we learned in class. We believe that for the time we were given and based off what we know as students, not professionals, that we created something we should be proud of. 

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

## Approach

Originally in our proposal and in our mid-semester progress report, we stated that we wanted to try implementing the YOLOv3 model, and though we seriosuly tried to do so, we unfortunately ran into some problems implementing it, so we decided to switch over to our own simpler CNN model. We used TensorFlow and Keras to train this model based off a dataset consisting of over 4,000 images (2166 images with properly-masked people and 1931 images of individuals not masking properly).

## Problems Encountered

As stated before, our initial idea was to implement the YOLOv3 model, but we encountered a few problems along the way. Here are some of them.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Harman-SC/639Website/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
